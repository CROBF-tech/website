March 8 marks **International Women's Day**, but do you know why?

My name is Ana and I am part of CROBF, a company that has three women on this team, that's why today today I want to tell you about the background of this day and also about some women who have been pioneers in the world of programming and software development.

## A Fire That Changed Everything.

In the late 19th century, the first organized strikes by women in the United States emerged, demanding, among other things, better working conditions. To learn about the history leading up to the New York fire, check out the following video:

On March 25, 1911, at the Triangle Shirtwaist factory in New York, 129 women lost their lives in a fire from which they could not escape due to all exit doors being locked.

For this reason, in honor of the first women's strike that took place years before this tragedy and in remembrance of the victims of the New York fire, the United Nations (UN) declared March 8 as International Women's Day in 1977.

## **Pioneering Women in the Tech World.**

In the world of technology, there are names that marked a turning point. Two of them are Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper, visionary women who laid the foundations of programming as we know it today.

**Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)** was the first person to imagine a machine capable of executing any type of calculation through programmed instructions. Working alongside Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine, she wrote the first algorithm in history, making her the world's first programmer. Her vision went beyond simple mathematical calculations, she understood that machines could process not just numbers but also information in different formats such as music and text.

**Grace Hopper (1906-1992)**, on the other hand, was a pioneer in creating more accessible programming languages. While working in the U.S. Navy, she developed the first compiler and laid the foundation for COBOL, a language that made programming understandable to more people. She also popularized the term "bug" in computing after discovering an error caused by a moth trapped in a computer relay.

### **Argentinian Women in Technology.** 

Argentina also has great women who have left their mark on the history of technology and computing.

**Elena Lagorio** was a key figure in the creation of Clementina, Argentina's first scientific computer, installed in 1961 at the University of Buenos Aires. Her work contributed to the development of computing in the country, paving the way for future generations of programmers and scientists.

**InÃ©s Barbero** is recognized for her work in the history of technology and computing in Argentina. She has researched the role of women in these fields and has given visibility to their impact on software development and computing.

**Clotilde Tisminetzky** was one of the first programmers in Argentina, playing a fundamental role in the development of systems and software in the country. Her work helped lay the foundations of the national computer industry.

### **Women in Technology: Experiences from CROBF**

To learn more about the experiences of women in the tech world today, we conducted a short interview with our colleagues at CROBF. Here are their answers:

ðŸ”¹ **What inspired you to enter the world of technology?**  

_"**Sofi**: Since I was little, I loved using my dadâ€™s computer. At first, I used it to play Need for Speed Most Wanted or FlatOut 2, but over time, I discovered Scratch and started creating small games. At the time, I didnâ€™t know exactly what I was doing or that it had anything to do with programming, but I loved the idea of creating something from scratch. Later, I found out there was a career related to this, and I knew it was for me. My curiosity and that feeling of being able to create new things motivated me to enter the tech world."_

_"**Juli**: Since I was a child, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by technological advances and how fast everything progresses. The idea of being part of it excites me a lot."_

_"**Ana**: I started programming at a very young age using Scratch, without even knowing what it was or what programming meant. When I chose my high school, it was a technical school, and the part that interested me the most was programming, giving instructions to a machine, an Arduino, or even a PLC. 
So, I looked for a career that would allow me to keep growing in this field, and thatâ€™s how I found Software Development."_
ðŸ”¹ **What do you like most about working in technology?**
_"**Sofi**: What I love the most is the ability to create innovative solutions and see how my ideas become something real and useful. I love that technology is constantly evolving, allowing me to learn new things all the time. I also enjoy working in a team, collaborating with others, and solving problems together. For me, technology is a space where creativity and logic come together, and thatâ€™s something Iâ€™m passionate about."_

_"**Juli**: Itâ€™s incredible how thereâ€™s never just one way to create, find, or improve solutions, programs, etc. Being able to reach effectiveness just by going with the flow is amazing.."_

_"**Ana**: What I love most about my career are the challenges because they never end. Thereâ€™s always something new to learn, to understand, or to discover. This allows me to expand my knowledge and way of thinking. Technology is a world that teaches you many things for life, from the fact that you keep trying until it works and even the importance of the small details that make a big difference in a job. "_

ðŸ”¹ **What message would you give to other women who want to start in this field?**
_"**Sofi**:  Iâ€™d tell them to go for it. The world of technology is huge, and there are so many areas to specialize in, from programming and design to AI, cybersecurity, or robotics. Donâ€™t be afraid to explore and try new things. If youâ€™re curious about something, go for it! The most important thing is to trust in your abilities and know that you have so much to contribute. Technology needs more diverse voices, and you can be part of that change."_

_"**Juli**: We must encourage each other as women and unite. The tech world is open to everyone, with many people ready to help. We can grow by innovating together."_

_"**Ana**: If you donâ€™t know what you want to do, learn to program. Even if itâ€™s not your passion, it will still be a valuable skill whether for using software or for learning to analyze, question, and materialize ideas in a simple way.
At first, it can be intimidating; itâ€™s a world full of surprises and challenges that seem impossible to overcome. But thereâ€™s a whole network of people who make the process easier: colleagues, teachers, specialists, etc. Thousands of people who have contributed to ensuring that today, many women have access to high-quality educational content that allows them to train and grow, such as Hexadevs, the CROBF academy that was launched yesterday to the public and in which I fully trust as a learning tool for everyone.
And finally, never doubt your value in this industry. We still need more women in tech, working together to create tools that will transform this world into a better place for everyone."_

### **Let's Keep Paving the Way**

History shows us that women have been present in technology since its beginnings, and today, we continue adding more names to that list. At **CROBF**, we believe in a future where more women become part of the tech world, bringing their talent, creativity, and vision.

Letâ€™s keep building a more inclusive space where all women can grow, innovate, and leave their mark. Change starts with each of us! ðŸ’œðŸš€
