## About Me

Hi! I'm **Casiano Ezequiel**.

As a leader, I turn ideas into high‑impact products: I define the **vision and roadmap**, prioritize by value, and coordinate cross‑functional teams to deliver scalable, measurable solutions.

I lead strategy and technical execution — from prototypes and MVPs to production architectures — backed by experience in **frontend, backend, infrastructure, and CI/CD** (React, Astro, Node/Express, Python/Flask, AWS/GCP, Docker).

I make decisions based on **metrics and the voice of the user** to reduce risk, accelerate time‑to‑market, and maximize adoption.
